Hello World, 

This repository contains my full works to date. I will be starting from scratch and updating it weekly. It will contain everything from; Proof of Concepts, Capture the Flag Walkthroughs, any disclosable security write ups (permission from the company/individual  of course), tutorials, malware write ups and anything I find relevant. 
Each update will be dated in here with the week number (Week #"Number") and the date the update ocurred (dd/mm/yy) I'm from the UK.
